## History Visualization
In this chapter you will learn about visualizing the history of a Git
repository in varying formats by learning the following topics:

* How to filter `git log` output commits by various criteria
* How to format `git log` output to display the information you care about
* How to find why and when a line in a file was changed, and who changed it
  using `git blame`
* How to identify which commit caused a particular bug using `git bisect`

When working with Git repository on large, long-running software projects
you'll sometimes want to dig through the history to identify old versions of
code, work out why and by whom changes were made, analyze the changes to e.g.
identify why a bug is occurring. You can do this to a limited extent using the
commands you've already learnt (`git log` and `git diff`) and extend this with
two more we'll cover in this chapter: `git blame` and `git bisect`.

Let's start by learning how to optimize our use of `git log` to only list only
particular commits.

### List only certain commits
Sometimes when examining history you will want to filter the commits that are
display based on some of their metadata. Perhaps you are tracking down a commit
that you can remember was made on a rough date, by a particular person or with
a word in its commit message. You could do this manually but sometimes there
are too many commits in the history to scan through the `git log` or `gitx`
output in a timely fashion. For these cases the `git log` command has various
flags and arguments that can be used to filter the commits that are shown in
its output.

Let's start by trying to find a commit by author, date and commit message
simultaneously.

#### Problem
You wish to list the commits authored by Mike McQuaid, after 10th November 2013
with the string "file." in their message.

#### Solution
1.  Change to the directory containing your repository
    e.g. `cd /Users/mike/GitInPracticeRedux/`.
2.  Run `git log --author "Mike McQuaid" --after "Nov 10 2013" --grep 'file\.'`.
    The output should resemble:

.Filtered log output
```
# git log --author "Mike McQuaid" --after "Nov 10 2013" --grep 'file\.'

Date:   Thu Nov 28 15:39:38 2013 +0000

    Rename book file to first part file.
```
<1> most recent commit
<2> least recent commit

The filtered log output is the essentially the same as the `git log` output you
saw in <<01-IntroductionToLocalGit#viewing-history-git-log-gitk-gitx>> but with
only the commits that are matched by the specified arguments.

From the arguments provided to the log command:

* `--author` specifies a regular expression that matches the contents of the
  author. In the previous case it was searching for the author string `Mike
  McQuaid <mike@mikemcquaid.com>` and found a match as the string started with
  the requested 'Mike McQuaid'.
* `--after` (or `--since`) specifies that the only commits shown should be
  those that were made after the specified date. These dates can be in any
  format that Git recognizes such as `Nov 10 2013`, `2014-01-30`, `midnight` or
  `yesterday`.
* `--grep` specifies a regular expression that matches the contents of the
  commit message. `file\.` was used rather than `file.` to escape the `.`
  character.


.What are regular expressions?
NOTE: Regular expressions are search patterns that are typically used to match
these patterns inside of strings. There are multiple variants of regular
expressions and Git uses the POSIX regular expression format. Git uses them for
various filtering operations such as filtering by commit message or author as
we saw previously. Characters either have literal meanings e.g. `a` which will
always match a lowercase 'a' character or special meanings e.g. `.` which will
match any character. For example, `file.` will match the strings `files` or
`filed`. To turn a character with a special meaning into one with a literal
meaning you can escape them with a backslash e.g. `file\.` will match the
string `file.` but not the string `files`. I'm not going to cover regular
expressions in detail because they are beyond the scope of this book. Don't
worry if you don't fully understand them; what you've seen above should be more
than enough to work with Git and there are many resources online that can aid
you if you wish to pursue them further.

You have shown a subset of commits filtered by author, date and commit message.

#### Discussion
`git log` can take:

* a `--max-count` (or `-n`) argument to limit the number of commits that are
  shown in the log output. I tend to use this often when I know that I only
  care about something in the e.g. last 10 commits and don't want to scroll
  through more output than that.
* a `--reverse` argument to show the commits in ascending chronological order
  (i.e. the oldest commit first)
* a `--before` (or `--until`) argument which will only show commits before the
  given date. This is the reverse of `--after`.
* a `--merges` flag (or `--min-parents=2`) which will only show merge commits
  i.e. commits that have at least 2 parents. If you adopt a branch-heavy
  workflow with Git then this will be very useful in identifying what branches
  were merged and when.

##### `git show`
`git show` is a command similar to `git log` but shows a single commit. It also
defaults to showing what was changed in that commit. Remember from
<<01-IntroductionToLocalGit#viewing-history-git-log-gitk-gitx>> that `git log`
has a `--patch` (or -p) argument to show what was changed by each commit in its
output.

.Show commit output
[.long-annotations]
```
# git show HEAD^

commit 06b5eb58b62ba8bbbeee258705c636ca7ac20b49 <1>

-Git Sandwich
```
<1> commit information
<2> commit diff

From the show commit output:

* "commit information (1)" shows all the same information expected in `git log
  output` but only ever shows a single commit.
* "commit diff (2)" shows the changes that were made in that commit. It's the
  equivalent of typing `git diff HEAD^^..HEAD^` i.e. the difference between the
  previous commit and the one before it.

The `git show HEAD^` output is equivalent to `git log --max-count=1 --patch
HEAD^`.

### List commits with different formatting
The default `git log` output format is helpful but takes a minimum of 6 lines
of output to display each commit. It displays the commit SHA-1, author name and
email, commit date and the full commit message (each additional line of which
adds a line to the `git log` output). Sometimes you will want to display more
information and sometimes you will want to display less. You may even just have
a personal preference on how the output is presented that does not match how it
currently is.

Thankfully `git log` has some powerful formatting features with varied,
sensible supplied options and the ability to completely customize the output to
meet your needs.

.Why are commits structured like emails?
NOTE: Remember in
<<01-IntroductionToLocalGit#viewing-history-git-log-gitk-gitx>> I mentioned
that commits are structured like emails? This is because Git was initially
created for use by the Linux kernel project which has a high-traffic mailing
list. People frequently send commits (know as "patches") to the mailing list.
Previously there was an implicit format that people used to turn a requested
change into an email for the mailing list but Git can convert commits to and
from an email format to facilitate this. Commands such as `git format-patch`,
`git send-mail` and `git am` (an abbreviation for "apply mailbox") can work
directly with email files to convert them to/from Git commits. This is
particularly useful to open-source projects where everyone can access the Git
repository but fewer people have write access to it. In this case someone could
send me an email which contains all the metadata of a commit using one of these
commands . Nowadays typically this will be done with a GitHub pull request
instead (which we'll cover in Chapter 11).

Let's display some commits in an email-style format.

#### Problem
You wish to list the last two commits in an email format with the eldest
displayed first.

#### Solution
1.  Change to the directory containing your repository
    e.g. `cd /Users/mike/GitInPracticeRedux/`.
2.  Run `git log --format=email --reverse --max-count 2'`.
    The output should resemble:

.Email formatted log output
[.long-annotations]
```
# git log --format=email --reverse --max-count 2

From: Mike McQuaid <mike@mikemcquaid.com> <2>
Date: Thu, 28 Nov 2013 15:49:30 +0000 <3>
Subject: [PATCH] Remove unfavourable review file. <4>


From 36640a59af951a26e0793f8eb0f4cc8e4c030167 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001
From: Mike McQuaid <mike@mikemcquaid.com>
Date: Thu, 28 Nov 2013 15:57:43 +0000
Subject: [PATCH] Ignore .tmp files.
```
<1> unix mailbox date
<2> commit author
<3> commit date
<4> commit subject

From the email formatted log output:

* "unix mailbox date (1)" can be safely ignored. The first part is the SHA-1
  hash for the commit. The log output is generated in the Unix "mbox" (short
  for "mailbox") format. The second, date part is not affected by the commit
  date or contents but is a special value used to indicate that this was
  outputted from Git rather than taken from real Unix mbox.
* "commit author (2)" is the author of the commit. This is one of the reasons
  why Git stores a name and email address for authors and in commits; it eases
  the transition to email format. A commit can seen as an email sent by the
  author of the commit requesting a change be made.
* "commit date (3)" is the date on which the commit was made. This also sets the
  date for the email in its headers.
* "commit subject (4)" is the first line of the commit message prefixed with
  "[PATCH]". This is another reason to structure your commit messages like
  emails (as mentioned in
  <<01-IntroductionToLocalGit#viewing-history-git-log-gitk-gitx>>).

If there is more than one line in a commit message then the other lines will be
shown as the message body. Remember if you use the `--patch` (or `-p`) argument
then `git log` output will also include the changes made in the commit. With
this argument provided each outputted `git log` entry will contain the commit
and all the metadata necessary to convert it to or from an email.

#### Discussion
If you specify the `--patch` (or `-p`) flag to `git log` then you can also
format the diff output by specifying flags for `git diff` too. Recall word
diffs from <<01-IntroductionToLocalGit#diff-formats>>. `git log --patch
--word-diff` will show the word diff (rather than unified diff) for each log
entry.

`git log` can take a `--date` flag which takes various parameters to display
the output dates in different formats. For example, `--date=relative` displays
all dates relative to the current date e.g. `6 weeks ago` and `--date-short`
displays only the date e.g. `2013-11-28`. There is also `iso` (or iso8601),
`rfc` (or `rfc2822`), `raw`, `local` and `default` formats available but I
won't detail them all in this book.

The `--format` (or `--pretty`) flag can take various parameters such as `email`
that we've seen in this example, `medium` which is the default if no format was
specified or `oneline`, `short`, `full`, `fuller` or `raw`. I won't show every
format in this book but please compare and contrast them on your local machine.
Different formats are better used in different situations depending on how much
of their displayed information you care about at that time.

You may have noticed the "full" output contains details about an author and a
committer and the "fuller" output additionally contains details of the author
date and commit date.

.Fuller log snippet
```
# git log --format=fuller

commit 334181a038e812050051776b69f0a80187abbeed
Author:     BrewTestBot <brew-test-bot@googlegroups.com>
AuthorDate: Thu Jan 9 23:48:16 2014 +0000
Commit:     Mike McQuaid <mike@mikemcquaid.com>
CommitDate: Fri Jan 10 08:19:50 2014 +0000

    rust: add 0.9 bottle.

...
```

This snippet shows a single commit from Homebrew, an open-source project
accessible at https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew. This was used as in the
`GitInPracticeRedux` repository all the previous commits will have the same
author and committer, author date and commit date.

.Why do commits have an author and committer?
NOTE:This fuller commit output shows that for a commit there are two recorded
actions: the original author of the commit and the committer; the person who
added this commit to the repository. These two attributes are both set at `git
commit` time. If they are both set at once then why are they separate values?
Remember that we've seen repeatedly that commits are like emails, can be
formatted as emails and sent to others. If I have a public repository on GitHub
then other users can clone my repository but cannot commit to it.

In these cases they may send me commits through a pull request (which will be
discussed in Chapter 11) or by email. If I want include these in my repository
the separation between committing and authoring means I can then include these
commits and Git stores the person who e.g. made the code changes and the person
who added these changes to the repository (hopefully after reviewing them).
This means you can keep the original attribution for the person who did the
work but still record the person who added the commit to the repository and
(hopefully) reviewed it. This is particularly useful in open-source software;
with other tools such as Subversion if you don't have commit access to a
repository the best attribution you could hope for would be e.g. "Thanks to
Mike McQuaid for this commit!" in the commit message.

In Subversion the equivalent `git blame` command is `svn blame`. It also has an
alias called `svn praise`. In Git there is no such alias by default (but
<<07-GitShortcuts#aliasing-commands>> will show you how to create one
yourself). I'm sure there's a joke to be made about the fact that Subversion
offers praise and blame equally but Git offers only blame!

##### Custom output format
If none of the `git log` output formats meets your needs you can create your
own custom formats using a _format string_. The format string uses placeholders
to fill in various attributes per commit.

Let's try and create a more prose-like format for `git log`:

.Custom prose log format
```
# git log --format="%ar %an did: %s"

6 weeks ago Mike McQuaid did: Ignore .tmp files.
6 weeks ago Mike McQuaid did: Remove unfavourable review file.
6 weeks ago Mike McQuaid did: Add first review temporary file.
6 weeks ago Mike McQuaid did: Rename book file to first part file.
9 weeks ago Mike McQuaid did: Start Chapter 2.
3 months ago Mike McQuaid did: Joke rejected by editor!
3 months ago Mike McQuaid did: Improve joke comic timing.
3 months ago Mike McQuaid did: Add opening joke. Funny?
3 months ago Mike McQuaid did: Initial commit of book.
```

Here we've specified the format string with `%ar %an did: %s`. In this format
string:

* `%ar` is the relative format date on which the commit was authored.
* `%an` is the name of the author of the commit.
* `did :` is text that's displayed the same in every commit and isn't a
  placeholder.
* `%s` is the commit message subject i.e. first line.

You can see the complete list of these placeholders in `git log --help`. There
are too many for me to detail them all in this book. The large number of
placeholders should mean it you can customize `git log` output into almost any
format.

##### Release logs: git shortlog
`git shortlog` shows the output of `git log` in a format that's typically used
for open-source software release announcements. It displays commits grouped by
author with one commit subject per line.

.Short log output
```
# git shortlog HEAD~6..HEAD

Mike McQuaid (9):  <1>
      Joke rejected by editor! <2>
      Start Chapter 2.
      Rename book file to first part file.
      Add first review temporary file.
      Remove unfavourable review file.
      Ignore .tmp files.
```
<1> commit author
<2> commit message

From the short log output:

* "commit author (1)" shows the name of the author of the following commits and
  how many commits they have made.
* "commit subject (2)" shows the first line of the commit message.

The commit range (`HEAD~6..HEAD`) is optional but typically you'd want to use
one to create a software release announcement for any version after the first.

##### The ultimate log output
As mentioned previously often the `git log` output is too verbose or does not
display all the information you wish to query in a compact format. It's also
not obvious from the output how local or remote branches relate to the output.

I have a selection of format options I refer to as my "ultimate log output".
Let's look at the output with these options:

.Graph log output
```
# git log --oneline --graph --decorate

* 36640a5 (HEAD, origin/master, origin/HEAD, master) Ignore .tmp files.
* 06b5eb5 Remove unfavourable review file.
* fcd8f6e Add first review temporary file.
* c6eed66 Rename book file to first part file.
* ac14a50 Start Chapter 2.
* 07fc4c3 Joke rejected by editor!
* 85a5db1 Improve joke comic timing.
* 6b437c7 Add opening joke. Funny?
* 6576b68 Initial commit of book.
```

This output format displays each commit on a single line. The line begins with
a branch graph indicator (which I will explain shortly), follows with the short
SHA-1 (which is useful for quickly copying-and-pasting), the branches, tags,
HEAD that points to this commit in parentheses and ends with the commit subject.

As you may have noticed this format is quite similar to that of the first two
columns of GitX:

.GitX graph output
image::screenshots/04-GitXGraph.png[]

The `GitInPracticeRedux` repository does not currently have any merge commits.
Let's see what the graph log output looks like with some of them.

.Graph log merge commit snippet
```
# git log --oneline --graph --decorate

*   129cce6 (origin/master, origin/HEAD, master) Merge branch 'testing'
|\
| * a86067a (origin/testing, testing) testing branch commit
* | 1a36bd6 master branch commit

...
```

Here you can see the branch graph indicator becoming more useful. Like the
graphical tools we've seen in
<<01-IntroductionToLocalGit#viewing-history-git-log-gitk-gitx>> this displays
branch merges and the commits on different branches using ASCII symbols to draw
lines. The `*` means a commit that was made. Each "line" follows a single
branch. Reading from the bottom up e can see from the above listing that there
was a commit made on the `master` branch, a commit made on the `testing` branch
and then the `testing` branch was merged into `master`. Both `testing` and
`master` branches remain (i.e. haven't been deleted) and both have been pushed
to their respective remote branches. All this from just three lines of ASCII
output. Hopefully you can see why I love this presentation. As typing `git log
--oneline --graph --decorate` is a bit unwieldy we'll see in
<<07-GitShortcuts#shorten-commands>> how to shorten this using an alias to
something like `git l`.

### Show who last changed each line of a file: git blame
I'm sure all developers have been in a situation where they've seen some line
of code in a file and wonder why it is was written that way. As long as the
file is stored in a Git repository it's easy to query who, when and why (given
a good commit message was used) a certain change is made.

You could do this by using `git diff` or `git log --patch` but neither of these
tools are optimized for this particular use-case; they both usually require
reading through a lot of information you aren't interested in to find the
information you are.

Instead let's see how to use the command designed specifically for this
use-case: `git blame`.

#### Problem
You wish to show the commit, person and date in which each line of
`GitInPractice.asciidoc` was changed.

#### Solution
1.  Change to the directory containing your repository
    e.g. `cd /Users/mike/GitInPracticeRedux/`.
2.  Run `git blame --date=short 01-IntroducingGitInPractice.asciidoc`.
    The output should resemble:

.Blame output
```
# git blame --date=short 01-IntroducingGitInPractice.asciidoc

^6576b68 GitInPractice.asciidoc (Mike McQuaid 2013-09-29 1)
 = Git In Practice
6b437c77 GitInPractice.asciidoc (Mike McQuaid 2013-09-29 2)
 == Chapter 1
07fc4c3c GitInPractice.asciidoc (Mike McQuaid 2013-10-11 3)
 // TODO: think of funny first line that editor will approve.
ac14a504 GitInPractice.asciidoc (Mike McQuaid 2013-11-09 4)
 == Chapter 2
ac14a504 GitInPractice.asciidoc (Mike McQuaid 2013-11-09 5)
 // TODO: write two chapters
```

Firstly, note that the output shows `GitInPractice.asciidoc` rather than
`01-IntroducingGitInPractice.asciidoc`. This is because the filename has been
changed since these changes were made. `git blame` is only showing changes to
lines in the file and ignoring that the file was renamed. This is useful as it
means you do not lose all blame data whenever you rename a file.

From the blame output:

* `--date=short` is used to display only the date (not the time). This accepts
  the same formats as the `--date` flag for `git log`. This was used in the
  above listing to make it more readable as `git blame` lines tend to be very
  long.
* The `^` (caret) prefix on the first line indicates that this line was
  inserted in the initial commit.
* Each line contains the short SHA-1, filename (if the line was changed when
  the file had a different name), parenthesized name, date, line number and
  finally the line contents itself. For example, in commit `6b437c77` on 29th
  September 2013 Mike McQuaid added the `== Chapter 1` line to
  `GitInPractice.asciidoc` (although the file is now named
  `01-IntroducingGitInPractice.asciidoc`).

You have shown who changed each line of a file, in which commit and when the
commit was made.

#### Discussion
`git blame` has a `--show-email` (or `-e`) flag which can show the email
address of the author instead of the name.

You can use the `-w` flag to ignore whitespace changes when finding where the
line changes came from. Sometimes people will fix e.g. indentation or
whitespace on a line which makes no functional difference to the code in most
programming languages. In these cases you want to ignore whitespace changes so
you can look at the changes that actually affect program behavior.

The `-s` flag hide the author name and date from in the output. This can be
useful for displaying a more concise output format and instead looking up this
information by passing the SHA-1 to `git show` at a later point.

If the `-L` flag is specified and followed with a line range e.g. `-L 40,60`
then only the lines in that range will be shown. This can be useful if you know
already what subset of the file you care about and don't want to have to search
through it again in the `git blame` output.

### Find which commit caused a particular bug: git bisect
The only thing worse than finding a bug in software and having to fix it is
having to fix the same bug multiple times. A bug that was found, fixed and has
appeared again is typically known as a _regression_.

The usual workflow for finding regressions is fairly painful. You typically
will keep going back in the version control history until you find a commit in
which the bug isn't present, go forward until you find where it happens again
and repeat the process to narrow it down. It's typically a rather tedious
exercise which is made worse by your having to fix the same problem again.

Thankfully Git has a useful tool that makes this process much easier for you:
`git bisect`. This uses a binary search algorithm to identify the problematic
commit as quickly as possible.

For a simple example let's try and find a commit which renamed a particular
file (without manually looking through the history).

#### Problem
You wish to locate the commit that renamed `GitInPractice.asciidoc` to
`01-IntroducingGitInPractice.asciidoc`.

#### Solution
1.  Change to the directory containing your repository
    e.g. `cd /Users/mike/GitInPracticeRedux/`.
2.  Run `git bisect start`. There will be no output.
3.  Run `git bisect bad`. There will be no output.
4.  Run `git bisect good 6576b6` where `6576b6` is the SHA-1 of any commit that
    you know was before the rename. The output should resemble <<bisect-good>>.
5.  Run `git bisect good` when the filename is `GitInPractice.asciidoc` and `git
    bisect bad` when the filename is `01-IntroducingGitInPractice.asciidoc`. The
    output should be similar each time.
6.  Eventually the first bad commit will be found.
    The output should resemble <<bisect-bad>>.
7.  Run `git bisect reset`.
    The output should resemble Listing <<bisect-log>>.

.First good bisect output
[[bisect-good]]
[.long-annotations]

[ac14a50465f37cfb038bdecd1293eb4c1d98a2ee] Start Chapter 2. <2>
```
<1> steps remaining
<2> new commit

From the good bisect output:

* "steps remaining (1)" shows how many revisions remain untested and, using the
  binary search algorithm, roughly how many more `git bisect` invocations
  remain until you find the problematic commit.
* "new commit (2)" shows the new commit SHA-1 that `git bisect` has checked out
  for examining whether this commit is "good" (the bug isn't present) or "bad"
  (the bug is present).

<1> bisect result
<2> commit information
<3> new object metadata
<4> old object metadata

From the final bisect output:

* "bisect result (1)" shows the commit that has been identified to cause the
  bug or, in this case, the rename. This matches the commit message here so
  this is a slightly silly example but typically this will allow you to then
  examine these changes and identify what in this commit caused the regression.
* "commit information (2)" shows the `git show` information for this commit.
* "new object metadata (3)" shows the old and new file mode and SHA-1 for the
  new object (i.e. after renaming).
* "old object metadata (4)" shows the old and new file mode and SHA-1 for the
  old object (i.e. before renaming).

You have located the commit that renamed `GitInPractice.asciidoc`.

#### Discussion
.bisect binary search performance
|===
|Total commits|Max checked commits|

|  10| 6|
| 100|13|
|1000|19|
|===

As you can see from the table above as the number of commits increases the max
number of commits that need to be checked increases much more slowly. This
algorithm means that you can quickly navigate through a huge numbers of commits
with `git bisect` without too many steps.

If you wish to examine the steps that you followed in a `git bisect` operation
then you can run `git bisect log`:

.Bisect log output
[[bisect-log]]
```
# git bisect log

# first bad commit: [c6eed6681efc8d0bff908e6dbb7d887c4b3fab3e] <4>
 Rename book file to first part file.
```
<1> bisect command
<2> commit SHA-1
<3> commit subject
<4> bisect result

From the bisect log output:

* "bisect command (1)" shows the `git bisect` command that you invoked at this
  step.
* "commit SHA-1 (2)" shows the status and SHA-1 of a commit.
* "commit subject (3)" shows the commit subject of a commit.
* "bisect result (4)" shows the final result of the whole bisect operation.

If you already know that bug has come from particular files or paths in the
working tree then you can specify these to `git bisect start`. For example, if
you knew that the changes that caused the regression were in the `src/gui`
directory then you could run `git bisect start src/gui`. This means that only
the commits that changed the contents of this directory will be checked and
this makes things even faster.

If it's difficult or impossible to tell if a particular commit is good or bad
you can run `git bisect skip` which will ignore it. Given there are enough
other commits then `git bisect` will use another to narrow the search instead.

##### Automating git bisect
Although `git bisect` is already useful wouldn't it be even better if, rather
than having to keep typing `git bisect good` or `git bisect bad`, it could run
automatically and tell you which commit caused the regression? This is possible
with `git bisect run`.

`git bisect run` is run instead of `git bisect good` or `git bisect bad` (i.e.
after a `git bisect start` and before a `git bisect reset`) and automates the
running of `git bisect good` and `git bisect bad`. It uses the exit code of a
process to identify whether the command was successful or not. For example, if
you run the command `ls GitInPractice.asciidoc` it returns an exit code of `0`
on success (when the file is present) and `1` on failure (when the file is
not). Let's take advantage of this to use it with `git bisect run`:

.Bisect run output
```
# git bisect run ls GitInPractice.asciidoc

The output is identical to the `git bisect log` output or the combined output
of all the other `git bisect` operations. No human intervention is required in
the above output; it just ran until it reached a result.

A typical case would be writing a unit test that reproduces a regression and
using that with `git bisect run` to quickly test a large number of commits.

.How can I stop `git bisect` from overwriting my test?
NOTE: As `git bisect good` and `git bisect bad` perform a `git checkout` each
time you need to make sure that the regression test is not overwritten by other
files or committed after the earliest "bad" commit. The easiest way of doing
this is to make a copy of the test in another directory outside the Git working
directory so `git bisect run` will not change its contents as it checks out
different commits.

### Summary
In this chapter you hopefully learned:

* How to filter `git log` output by author, date, commit message, merge commits
* How to display only a single commit or requested number of commits
* How to display `git log` output in various formats
* How to display commits in an open-source release announcement format
* How to display branching effectively with `git log`
* How to show who changed each line of a file, when, why and what was the
  original filename
* How to use `git bisect` to search quickly (but manually) through the history
  with `git bisect good` and `git bisect bad` to identify regressions
* How to use `git bisect run` to search automatically through the history
  to identify regressions with a test

Now that you've learned how to better understand history let's learn how to
make it more complex but learning advanced branching techniques.
