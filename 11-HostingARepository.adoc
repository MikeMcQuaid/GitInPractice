## Hosting a repository
ifdef::env-github[:outfilesuffix: .adoc]

We saw in <<02-RemoteGit#adding-a-remote-repository-git-remote-add>> how to push to remote repositories provided by various organizations on the internet as a way of sharing your Git repositories with others. Sometimes though you may wish to host a remote Git repository on a machine you control, for example to:

* Temporarily share a Git repository on your machine with another computer on the same network
* Keep a full backup of an external Git repository on a server you control
* Provide an internal mirror of an external Git repository to allow faster transfer speeds
* Host a Git repository on a server entirely under your own control

// BEN: unclear: "sharing and viewing a repository on my machine with repositories on other machines" 
I personally only use the commands in this chapter for basic sharing and viewing of a repository on my machine with repositories on other machines on the same network (rather than over the internet). Though we'll see more advanced tools in <<advanced-git-hosting>>, this chapter is focused on understanding the features provided by Git itself and how it works, rather than more advanced Git hosting solutions. In essence, this chapter is a guide for software engineers to understand how Git repositories can be shared and not a guide for system administrators on how set up Git servers. Unless you're an experienced system administrator, I'd advise using on an external Git hosting provider (such as GitHub) rather than running your own Git servers. We'll cover Git's repository hosting commands by learning about the following topics:

// BEN: usual Manning style is just "In this chapter" and then the bullets. (all the above would go below the intro bullets)
// BEN: also, some of these bullets are a bit too long... should be no more than 8 words each
* How to create a repository in a format used for hosting as a server
* How to mirror an existing repository for hosting as a server
* How to share the contents of a repository with users on the same network
* How to display the contents of a repository in a web browser
* How to provide more advanced Git hosting with other software

### Initialize a local repository in a server hosting format: git init --bare
The Git repositories we've seen throughout this book have all had a similar structure: the working directory contains a checkout of the files in the current branch and a `.git` subdirectory which contains the repository data.
For example, if we had a `GitInPracticeNonBare.git` repo, its contents might resemble the following:

.Typical repository layout
[[repo-non-bare]]
image::screenshots/11-RepoNonBare.png[]

You can see from <<repo-non-bare>> that it has only the `README.md` file and the `.git` repository data subdirectory in the root.

Git stores data in a highly space-efficient format. The checked-out files in a repository's working directory may sometimes take up more space than the compressed version of all files stored in the `.git` directory!

On a server, the working directory should never be used directly, so it's better to not create one at all. As you'll just be sending/receiving Git objects to/from various Git clients with `git push`, `git fetch`, or `git pull`, you don't need to have the actual files checked out on disk. A Git repository without a working directory is known as a _bare repository_. The major difference compared to the first repository we created in <<01-LocalGit#creating-a-repository-git-init>> is that this repository isn't in a `.git` directory.

Let's create a bare repository and look at its contents.

#### Problem
You wish to create a bare Git repository.

#### Solution
1.  Change to the directory you wish to contain your new repository directory; for example, `cd /Users/mike/`.
2.  Run `git init --bare GitInPracticeBare.git`. The output should resemble the following:

.bare repository initialization output
```
# git init --bare GitInPracticeBare.git

Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/mike/GitInPracticeBare.git/ <1>
```
<1> Bare repository

From the bare repository initialization output:

* "Bare repository (1)" shows the new directory that was created for the bare Git repository. The major difference compared to the first repository we created in <<01-LocalGit#creating-a-repository-git-init>> is that this repository isn't in a `.git` directory.

You have successfully created a new bare Git repository.

#### Discussion
Bare repositories don't allow new commits to be created locally; they must be pushed from another repository.

.How should you name bare repositories?
NOTE: When creating bare repositories, it's good practice to name them with the extension '.git' to make it clear that they're bare.

Let's look at the layout of a bare repository:

.Bare repository layout
[[repo-bare]]
image::screenshots/11-RepoBare.png[]

You can see from <<repo-bare>> that the repository data which was stored in `.git` in <<repo-non-bare>> is instead in the root in <<repo-bare>>. This means the root of the repository is effectively the `.git` directory (which is why it's named `GitInPracticeBare.git`). The bare repository is missing an `index` file and `logs` directory, and instead has a `packed-refs` file. These differences are just internal Git files that are used for repositories; don't worry about their contents (although we'll see the `packed-refs` file in <<mirror-a-repository-git-clone-mirror>>).

To clone this Git repository into a non-bare repository on the same machine, run `git clone` with the path on disk to the repository and the new, non-bare repository name as arguments; for example, `git clone /Users/mike/GitInPracticeBare.git GitInPracticeNonBare`. In this case the output will resemble the following:

```
Cloning into 'GitInPracticeNonBare.git'...
warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository.
done
```

The new repository has been created but it's empty--it contains no commits. If you add a file, commit, and push it, then it'll be pushed to the bare repository and both repositories will now be non-empty. Note that you'd never usually be cloning a bare repository on the same machine, but would instead create a bare repository on one machine and clone it on another.

I've only personally used bare repositories in the past to create mirrors of existing repositories on a server I control. I didn't care about having the files checked-out into the working directory, but just wanted a copy of all the repository data. Let's learn how to use Git to create an exact mirror of another repository.

### Mirror a repository: git clone --mirror
There are times when you wish to host a new Git repository that's a mirror of another--a functionally identical copy. This could be for backup, providing a local cache for increased speed, or moving a repository to another location. Recall from <<02-RemoteGit#cloning-a-remote-github-repository-onto-your-local-machine-git-clone>> that `git clone` will create a clone of the repository locally with all commits, branches, and tags that are in the repository you've cloned from.

If you `git clone` a repository with a branch named `testing` then your new, local clone will contain a remote branch named `origin/testing`. But what if you wanted this to not only create the `origin/testing` remote branch but also a local branch named `testing`? In this case you'd use the `--mirror` flag for `git clone`, which creates local branches for all remote branches it finds (or, in Git terminology, it matches all refs locally). This is useful in cases where you want to create an exact copy of another repository (a mirror) so others could clone from it and get the same results as cloning from the original repository, or to keep as a backup. Recall _forks_ on GitHub from <<10-GitHubPullRequests#what-are-pull-requests-and-forks>>; `git clone --mirror` is effectively what GitHub does when you _fork_ a repository: it makes a complete copy that can be modified without changing the original repository and creates all the same branches.

Let's use `git clone --mirror` to set up a local mirror of the `GitInPracticeRedux` repository.

#### Problem
You wish mirror an existing remote repository.

#### Solution
1.  Change to the directory you wish to contain your new repository directory; on my system, `cd /Users/mike/`.
2.  Run `git clone --mirror https://github.com/GitInPractice/GitInPracticeRedux.git`. The output should resemble the following:

.clone mirror output
```
# git clone --mirror
  https://github.com/GitInPractice/GitInPracticeRedux.git

Cloning into bare repository 'GitInPracticeRedux.git'...<1>
remote: Reusing existing pack: 79, done.
remote: Counting objects: 1, done.
remote: Total 80 (delta 0), reused 1 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (80/80), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
```
<1> Bare repository

From the clone mirror output:

* "Bare repository (1)" shows that `git clone --mirror` will create a bare repository when it creates a mirror. This is because `--mirror` will only be used when hosting a repository for other repositories to pull from.

You have mirrored the existing `GitInPracticeRedux` repository.

#### Discussion
Recall from <<02-RemoteGit#cloning-a-remote-github-repository-onto-your-local-machine-git-clone>> the following flags for `git clone`:

* _No flags_--This will create a normal (non-bare) repository with remote branches.
* `--bare` flag--This will create a bare repository with remote branches.
* `--mirror` flag--This will create a bare repository with remote branches and local branches for every remote branch.

Let's examine the contents of `GitInPracticeRedux.git/packed-refs` file:
```
# pack-refs with: peeled fully-peeled
ca74d2b7c4dd15a260e68c6ff3552c64041aacdc refs/heads/inspiration <1>
a9e150fb17301eed6c31aa984411effdab8f3fec refs/heads/master <1>
a8200e1407d49e37baad47da04c0981f43d7c7ff refs/heads/v0.1-release <1>
071d468df295c3866054763250a1344e44f8c3be refs/pull/1/head <2>
75f9dd1ddc24e1fd9e58b8443f7f0176cf7bd2e7 refs/pull/1/merge <2>
e9d27c7df49c07cb2325356ab9a76f90d9f179ae refs/pull/2/head <2>
e6e9208372f3784686499430fec547c20dad6139 refs/pull/2/merge <2>
725c33ace6cd7b281c2d3b342ca05562d3dc7335 refs/tags/v0.1 <3>
```
<1> Branch
<2> Pull request
<3> Tag

The `packed-refs` file contains all the _packed_ refs (refs in Git's format for data internal and external transfer) that were fetched from the `GitInPracticeRedux` repository. It contains all the created branches (1), pull requests (2), and tags that were created in this repository. These will now be shared with any other repositories that clone this one.

### Share repository with other users on the same network: git daemon
Now that we've seen how to create bare repositories suitable for a server to share with other Git repositories, let's learn how to actually serve these to other Git clients.

We saw in <<initialize-a-local-repository-in-a-server-hosting-format-git-init-bare>> a repository being cloned from another path on the disk. Though this would be one way of sharing a repository over the network with Git (give someone access to your disk with, say, a network share) it's not very efficient, as it will use multiple protocols: the SMB protocol used to share the files over the network and Git's interaction with the packed repository. Instead a Git server will allow Git to interact natively in its own format and `git://` protocol, which transfers repository data in a very similar format to how it's stored locally and defaults to using port 9418.

Git provides a simple server for basic repository hosting named `git daemon`. It provides no user authentication or encryption, and only supports the `git://` protocol (rather than the `https://` we've used throughout this book, or `ssh://`, which uses SSH access). These protocols are fairly interchangeable; which one you pick will depend mostly on whether you need to make use of HTTP proxies or web servers (for the `https://` protocol), user authentication using SSH (for the `ssh://` protocol), or no authentication (for the `git://` protocol).

As a result, it may be too limited for some cases, but is great for the example in the section title: sharing a repository with other users on the same network.

#### Problem
You wish to share a repository with other users on the same network.

#### Solution
1.  Change directory to the Git repository; on my machine, `cd /Users/mike/GitInPracticeRedux.git/`.
2.  Run `git daemon --verbose --base-path=. --export-all`. The output should resemble the following:

.daemon output
```
# git daemon --verbose --base-path=. --export-all <1>

[72938] Ready to rumble <2>
```
<1> Daemon arguments
<2> Process ready

From the daemon output:

* "Daemon arguments (1)" shows the daemon command and the list of arguments required to export the Git repository. These will be elaborated on in the discussion section.
* "Process ready (2)" shows the process ID (72938), that the process has started successfully, and that it's ready to receive clients.

Now that we have `git daemon` running, open another terminal window and clone this repository from a client with `git clone git://localhost/`:
```
# git clone git://localhost/ GitInPracticeReduxDaemon <1>

Cloning into 'GitInPracticeReduxDaemon'...
remote: Counting objects: 78, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (71/71), done.
remote: Total 78 (delta 26), reused 0 (delta 0)
Receiving objects: 100% (78/78), 7.80 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (26/26), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
```
<1> Local server

The "local server (1)" displays that we're using `localhost` to access the Git daemon on the same machine that we're hosting it on. It has cloned the repository as expected into a new directory on the same machine. If you wanted to clone this from another machine, you'd replace `localhost` in the command with the IP address of the machine hosting the daemon on the network; for example, `git clone git://192.168.0.123/`.

If we view the daemon output again you'll see that some lines have been added:
```
[72984] Connection from [::1]:52891 <1>
[72984] Extended attributes (16 bytes) exist <host=localhost> <2>
[72984] Request upload-pack for '/' <3>
[72938] [72984] Disconnected <4>
```
<1> Client connection
<2> Attribute exposure
<3> Repository upload
<4> Client disconnect

These lines show that our Git client connected to the server (1), the repository exposed some attributes to the client (2), the client requested the server upload its contents to the client (3), and that the client then disconnected from the server.

You have successfully shared a repository over the network.

#### Discussion
`git daemon` can take some parameters to customize its behavior:
* The `--verbose` flag will output more verbose log details to the terminal about incoming Git client connections and access successes and failures. It's useful when hosting a server to enable this for debugging.
* The `--base-path=.` indicates what path should be used as the server root. In this case we only hosted a single repository, so we set the root to the base directory of the repository. If you wanted to host a directory that contained multiple repositories (such as `fish.git` and `cat.git`), you could specify the directory and then they could be accessed by name (`git clone git://localhost/fish.git` or `git clone git://localhost/cat.git`). As I tend to only use `git daemon` to share a single repository, I always tend to just use `--base-path=.`.
* The `--export-all` flag is used to tell Git to allow access to all Git repositories under the base path. Without this argument, by default `git daemon` will only allow access to repositories that have a `git-daemon-export-ok` file in the repository root (the root for bare repositories and `.git` for non-bare repositories). I always tend to use this, as I use `git daemon` so infrequently and only on repositories I explicitly, currently want to share.
* The `--enable=receive-pack` flag is needed to allow write access to the repository. By default `git daemon` will only allow read access (provided by `upload-pack`) to repositories unless this flag is provided. It's not recommended to provide write access to non-bare repositories, as it would be undesirable to have remote users be able to change the contents of your local branches.
* The directory argument is needed if you wish to host a non-bare repository. In this case you'd `cd` into the directory as normal but add a `./.git` argument specifying to share the `.git` directory. For example you might run `cd /Users/mike/GitInPracticeRedux && git daemon --verbose --base-path=. --export-all ./.git`. I use this when temporarily hosting non-bare repositories that I'm working with on my local machine with others.

### Display repository in a browser: git instaweb
Now that we've shared our repository on disk with other users, it would be useful if we could provide a basic web interface to go along with our `git daemon`. Git provides a basic web interface named `gitweb` that can be hosted by a local web server.

.How can I install `gitweb`?
NOTE: `gitweb` is usually installed as part of the default Git installation (and is in all of the official Git installers). If it hasn't been, you'll need to install `gitweb` separately. This can be done by installing `gitweb` (or similar) with your package manager; for example, on Debian/Ubuntu run `apt-get install gitweb`.

Git provides the `git instaweb` command to host your local repository using the `gitweb` interface. To run this you'll have to have a web server installed on your machine. If you're using OSX, you can use `webrick`, which is a simple web server provided with Ruby (which is provided with OSX). If you're on Linux, you can install Ruby with your package manager; for example, on Debian/Ubuntu run `apt-get install ruby` (we'll use `webrick` on Linux just to be consistent with OSX). Windows Git installation sadly doesn't provide the `git instaweb` command but you can read how to set up `gitweb` using a separate web server such as Apache or IIS here: https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/MSysGit:GitWeb.

Now that we have `git instaweb` setup, let's use it to display the repository in a browser.

#### Problem
You wish to display the contents of a repository in a browser.

#### Solution
1.  Change to the directory containing your repository; for example, `cd /Users/mike/GitInPracticeRedux/`.
2.  Write a description for the repository's web server by running `echo "Git In Practice: Redux" > .git/description`.
3.  Run `git instaweb --httpd=webrick`. There will be no output.

Git should have opened the `gitweb` interface in your browser. It should resemble the following:

.gitweb projects
[[gitweb-projects]]
image::screenshots/11-GitWebProjects.png[]

You can see from <<gitweb-projects>> that it displays a single Git project along with description we just set, the owner, and the last change (commit) date. Click on the Summary button to view more information about the `GitInPracticeRedux` project.

.gitweb summary
[[gitweb-redux]]
image::screenshots/11-GitWebRedux.png[]

The summary page in <<gitweb-redux>> displays the same information as the projects page, but also shows the list of recent commits, branches, and tags in a format resembling GitX/`gitk`.

Detailing all the features of the `gitweb` interface is beyond the scope of this book; it's pretty self-explanatory. After you've finished exploring the `gitweb` interface, you can stop the server by running `git instaweb --stop`.

You have successfully displayed the contents of the repository in a browser..

#### Discussion
`git instaweb` can take some parameters to customize its behavior:

* The `--local` flag will ensure that the web server can only be accessed from the local machine and not from other machines on the same network.
* The `--port` flag can be followed with a port number to specify which port should be used to access `gitweb`. For example `--port 8080` would mean that `gitweb` is hosted on port 8080.

### Advanced Git hosting
In addition to the tools provided with Git you've seen in this chapter, there is a wide third-party ecosystem of Git tools that can help you share your repositories and provide a web interface to view them. There are too many and their setup is too involved for me to detail them all here. Some of the most popular options are:

// BEN: we don't really do definition lists like this. we do bulleted lists with the intro term separated by an em-dash
GitHub::
    GitHub (https://github.com) is the most widely used Git hosting, and provides many features beyond sharing and viewing Git repositories. It provides free open-source public hosting and paid private hosting. Alternatively you can pay for GitHub Enterprise (https://enterprise.github.com), which provides a hosted GitHub appliance that can be run inside your network.

cgit::
    cgit (https://github.com/zx2c4/cgit) provides a fast Git web interface written in C. It uses forking and a cache to speed up operations and is widely used by open-source projects.

gitolite::
    gitolite (https://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite) provides access control for hosting Git repositories such as users, groups, per-branch/per-repository permissions, and hook support.

### Summary
In this chapter you hopefully learned:

* How to create a new bare repository with `git init --bare`
* How to mirror an existing repository with `git clone --mirror`
* How to share a repository across the network with `git daemon`
* How to display a web interface for a repository with `git instaweb`
* How to provide more advanced Git hosting with GitHub, cgit, and/or gitolite
